% @OUTPUT double[] ans

% This trivial script demonstrates the use of
% the "ans" variable in the SciJava-MATLAB
% script language.

% Unassigned statements in MATLAB are automatically
% assigned to "ans". However, these scripts will not
% return "ans" unless it is explicitly requested as
% an output parameter.
